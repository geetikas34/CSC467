Run:
compiler467 -Tn <name of input shader executable>

Default trace file: trace.txt
Default error file: error.txt
Test cases:
We ran our compiler with Demo1 and Demo2 available on the CSC467 website and obtained the required sequence of tokens. We also test the following cases:
-Overflow of integer values that are not in the (-2^21, 2^21) range
-Identifier length greater than 32
-Float out of range 
-Wrong format of identifiers
-Other sequence of characters not supported by MiniGLSL.

Issue Encountered:
We were getting a segmentation fault which later we discovered was due to printing a non terminated string. 

Team member contribution:
Both members of the team worked on all parts of the lab together and contributed equally.
